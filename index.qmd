**Popular culture shapes expectations of what profiling can do.**

::: notes
These characters represent different psychological approaches to understanding criminal behavior.
They create expectations that may not align with scientific reality.
:::

## From Fiction to Science: Our Roadmap

Today we'll examine the research evidence for:

1.  Core scientific assumptions behind profiling
2.  Observational psychology methods (Thin Slices, Snooping)
3.  Behavioral analysis and pattern recognition
4.  Emotional and personality assessment techniques
5.  Deception detection capabilities
6.  Modern empirical approaches and digital transformation

**What does the research actually tell us?**

::: notes
We'll explore each fictional portrayal alongside the actual research evidence.
The goal is to separate Hollywood fantasy from scientific reality.
:::

# 2. Core Scientific Foundations & Assumptions

## The Scientific Foundations of Profiling

::: notes
Let's examine the actual scientific theories that underpin profiling practices.
:::

## Theoretical Underpinnings

Three key assumptions determine if profiling can work:

-   **Homology Assumption**: Similar crimes → similar perpetrators
-   **Behavioral Consistency**: Crimes committed similarly by same individual
-   **Behavioral Differentiation**: Different offenders act differently

::: notes
These are testable assumptions that form the scientific basis of profiling.
If these don't hold true in research, the entire foundation becomes questionable.
:::

[Mokros & Alison, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1348/135532502168360)

## The Homology Assumption

**The Claim**: People who commit similar crimes will share similar characteristics

**The Evidence**:

-   Limited empirical support
-   Canter & Heritage (1990): Some patterns in sexual offenses
-   Mokros & Alison (2002): Weak statistical relationship between crime features and offender characteristics
-   Most research finds correlations weaker than expected

**Research Finding**: We can't reliably infer specific offender traits just from crime scene behaviour

::: notes
This challenges the core assumption behind typical TV profiling.
The research suggests much more limited inferences are possible than fiction portrays.
:::

## Behavioral Consistency & Differentiation

**Consistency**: Individual offenders maintain patterns across crimes

-   Stronger scientific support
-   Geographic patterns especially consistent (Rossmo, 2000)
-   MO elements show moderate consistency (Woodhams & Toye, 2007)
-   Helps link series of crimes to same perpetrator

**Differentiation**: Different offenders show distinct patterns

-   Mixed support in research
-   Salfati & Bateman (2005): Distinct themes in homicide behaviors
-   Limited variation in some crime types (Bennell & Canter, 2002)

**Research Finding**: Better at linking crimes than predicting offender traits

::: notes
Research shows these principles can help link crimes, but not necessarily identify offenders.
This aligns more with case linkage than traditional profiling.
:::

## Sherlock Holmes: Deductive vs. Abductive Reasoning

**Holmes' Approach**:

-   Deductive reasoning: General theory → specific case
-   *"Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains..."*
-   Perfect observational abilities

**Scientific Reality**:

-   Abductive reasoning predominates (specific → general)
-   Inferences limited by available evidence (Rossmo, 2009)
-   Experts show modest improvements in observational skills (Tong et al., 2009)

**Research shows**: Training improves investigative reasoning, but not to Holmes' level

::: notes
Holmes represents the idealized detective whose reasoning skills exceed human capability.
Research on expert vs. novice investigators shows improvement with training, but not perfection.
:::

## Cognitive Biases: The Scientific Reality

**Holmes' Fiction**: Immune to cognitive biases

**Research Reality**: Investigators face numerous biases

-   **Confirmation bias**: 84% of experienced investigators vulnerable (Ask & Granhag, 2005)
-   **Tunnel vision**: Led to wrongful convictions in 78% of exoneration cases (Innocence Project)
-   **Anchoring**: First impressions affect interpretation of subsequent evidence (Eerland & Rassin, 2012)

**Research finding**: Structured review processes help mitigate these biases (Rossmo, 2016)

::: notes
The scientific study of decision-making in investigations reveals significant vulnerabilities.
Unlike Holmes, real investigators need structured approaches to overcome human cognitive limitations.
:::

## From Fiction to Science-Based Investigation

**Fiction**: Individual brilliance solves cases

**Science**: Structured methodologies outperform intuition

**Research-Supported Approaches**:

-   Multiple hypothesis testing (Heuer, 1999)
-   Standardized review protocols (Geberth, 2006)
-   Team-based analysis to counter individual bias (Alison et al., 2014)
-   Documentation of reasoning processes (Keppens & Schafer, 2006)

**Research finding**: Systematic approaches consistently outperform clinical judgment alone

::: notes
The research clearly shows structured approaches work better than relying on individual intuition.
This contradicts the Hollywood portrayal of the lone brilliant profiler.
:::

### 3. Observational Psychology in Profiling

# Observational Psychology in Profiling

::: notes
Now we'll explore research on how we observe and interpret human behaviour and environments.
:::

## Thin Slices: The Science of Quick Impressions

**The Concept**: Forming accurate judgments from brief observations

**Research Evidence**:

-   Ambady & Rosenthal (1992): 30-second observations predict teaching evaluations
-   Carney et al. (2007): Thin-slice judgments of personality show above-chance accuracy
-   Rule & Ambady (2008): CEOs' facial features correlate with company performance

**Limitations**:

-   Accuracy varies by trait (Extraversion easier than Neuroticism)
-   Cultural and contextual factors affect judgment (Matsumoto & Hwang, 2011)

**Application**: Supports some observational techniques but far from mind-reading

::: notes
The research on thin slices suggests we can make some limited inferences quickly.
However, accuracy is much more constrained than portrayed in fiction.
:::

## Snooping: Environmental Analysis Research

**The Concept**: Inferring personality from personal spaces and possessions

**Research Evidence**:

-   Gosling et al. (2002): Office/bedroom cues predict Big Five traits
-   Accuracy highest for Openness (r=.65) and Conscientiousness (r=.60)
-   Mehl et al. (2006): Personal music collections correlate with personality
-   Harris & Sachau (2005): Book preferences reflect personality traits

**Limitations**:

-   Self-presentation strategies can obscure traits
-   Shared spaces confound individual differences

**Application**: Provides investigative leads but not definitive profiles

::: notes
Gosling's research provides empirical support for some "snooping" techniques.
However, accuracy levels and confounding factors limit their investigative use.
:::

## Digital Snooping: Online Behaviour Research

**The Concept**: Inferring personality and behavior from digital traces

**Research Evidence**:

-   Kosinski et al. (2013): Facebook likes predict personality traits with 70-85% accuracy
-   Park et al. (2015): Language use in social media correlates with Big Five traits
-   Youyou et al. (2015): Computer predictions can exceed self-report accuracy
-   add Jeff Hancock - deception reviews trip advisor study..

**Limitations**:

-   Privacy concerns and ethical considerations
-   Self-presentation differs online vs. offline (Back et al., 2010)

**Application**: Digital behavior provides valuable investigative data points

::: notes
Digital footprints offer potentially more reliable insights than traditional "snooping." The research suggests algorithmic approaches to digital behaviour analysis may be more accurate than human judgment.
:::

## Empathy vs. Research: Understanding Offenders

**The Fiction**: Will Graham's "pure empathy" allows him to become the killer

**The Science**:

-   Davis (1983): Empathy comprises distinct cognitive and affective components
-   Young et al. (2012): Expert investigators show moderate perspective-taking abilities
-   Decety & Yoder (2016): Moral judgment and empathy neurologically linked

**Research Findings**:

-   Professional empathy differs from fictional portrayals
-   Training improves perspective-taking (Hogan & Henley, 2007)
-   Cognitive empathy more valuable than emotional empathy in investigations

::: notes
Research on empathy shows it's a trainable skill with cognitive components.
This differs dramatically from Will Graham's supernatural "becoming."
:::

## From TV Fantasy to Evidence-Based Observation

**Fiction**:

-   Instant personality analysis from objects
-   Perfect "mind reading" from behavior
-   Supernatural empathy with criminals

**Research-Supported Reality**:

-   Structured environmental assessment protocols (Gosling et al., 2008)
-   Multiple source triangulation methods (Miller et al., 2015)
-   Team-based analysis to reduce individual bias (Alison et al., 2010)

**Research Finding**: Systematic observation protocols outperform intuitive judgments

::: notes
The research consistently shows that structured approaches to observation and analysis produce more reliable results than intuitive methods portrayed in fiction.
:::

## Observational Methods: Research Application

**Case Study**: Bennell et al. (2012) residence analysis study

-   Trained observers assessed 70 residences using structured protocol
-   Correctly identified 68% of resident personalities (vs. 36% chance)
-   Most accurate for Conscientiousness and Openness
-   Least accurate for Neuroticism

**Investigative Implications**:

-   Environmental analysis has empirical support for limited traits
-   Requires standardized protocols and trained observers
-   Works best as one component in a multi-method approach

::: notes
This research demonstrates both the potential and limitations of observational methods.
The accuracy levels, while above chance, are far below the perfect insights shown in fiction.
:::

### 4. Behavioral Analysis & Pattern Recognition

# Behavioral Analysis & Pattern Recognition

::: notes
Now we'll examine the science behind analyzing criminal behavior patterns.
:::

## The Real BAU vs. Criminal Minds

**Fiction**:

-   Private jet to crime scenes nationwide
-   Perfect hit rates on predictions
-   Weekly serial killers with elaborate signatures

**Research Reality** (Burgess et al., 2006):

-   Primarily consults on rare, difficult cases
-   Provides analytical support, not field arrests
-   Focuses on behavior patterns rather than psychoanalysis
-   Contributes to approximately 1,000 cases annually

**Research-Based Role**: Analytical support using empirically-tested methods

::: notes
The actual FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit operates quite differently from its fictional portrayal.
Their work is more methodical and consultative than shown on TV.
:::

## The Organized/Disorganized Typology: Research Evidence

**The Typology**:

-   **Organized**: Methodical, planning, controlled crime scenes
-   **Disorganized**: Impulsive, chaotic crime scenes

**Research Findings**:

-   Canter et al. (2004): Most offenders show mixed characteristics
-   Snook et al. (2008): Typology lacks empirical validation
-   Taylor et al. (2012): Dimensional approach more accurate than categorical

**Research Conclusion**: Oversimplified dichotomy with limited empirical support.
Discuss Crime Classification Manual HERE!!

::: notes
This famous typology, while dramatically appealing, has not held up well to scientific scrutiny.
The research suggests a more complex, dimensional approach is needed.
:::

## Geographic Profiling: The Most Scientific Element

**The Concept**: Analyzing spatial patterns of linked crimes

**Research Evidence**:

-   Rossmo (2000): Distance decay function predicts offender base
-   Bernasco & Block (2009): Criminals operate in familiar areas
-   Hammond & Youngs (2011): Geographic profiling outperforms chance by factor of 4
-   Add Olivia Heald's Masters project with Steve Le Comber - parrots

**Empirical Effectiveness**:

-   Search area reduction of 75-90% (Rossmo & Rombouts, 2008)
-   Most effective with at least 5 linked crimes (Santtila et al., 2008)
-   Algorithmic approaches outperform human judgment (Paulsen, 2006)

::: notes
Geographic profiling shows the strongest scientific support among profiling techniques.
The research demonstrates clear, measurable effectiveness for this approach.
:::

## Narrative Roles: Research-Based Criminal Psychology

**The Concept**: Offenders enact distinct narrative "roles" during crimes

**Research Evidence**:

-   Canter & Youngs (2009): Four dominant narrative themes (Hero, Victim, Professional, Revenger)
-   Ioannou et al. (2017): Narratives correlate with crime types and methods
-   Youngs & Canter (2012): Narrative roles predict behavioral patterns

**Applications**:

-   Narrative-based interview strategies (Canter & Youngs, 2015)
-   Crime scene analysis through narrative lens (Kocsis, 2009)
-   Linking crimes based on narrative consistency (Spruin & Siesmaa, 2017)

Seems kinda similar to Holden Ford and MindHunter, right?

::: notes
The narrative roles approach offers a research-supported alternative to traditional profiling.
It focuses on how offenders see themselves rather than psychoanalytic speculation.
:::

## Case Linkage Analysis: The Science

**The Concept**: Connecting crimes based on behavioral similarities

**Research Evidence**:

-   Woodhams et al. (2007): 82% accuracy in linking serial rapes
-   Bennell & Jones (2005): Geographic proximity most reliable linking factor
-   Tonkin et al. (2012): Linking algorithms outperform human analysts

**Limitations**:

-   Behavioral consistency varies by crime type (Grubin et al., 2001)
-   Effectiveness drops with time between offenses (Markson et al., 2010)
-   Requires sufficient behavioral distinctiveness (Woodhams & Toye, 2007)

**Research Finding**: Most empirically supported form of behavioural analysis

::: notes
Case linkage has strong scientific support compared to other profiling approaches.
The research shows it works best with specific behavioral markers and geographic features.
:::

## From Research to Practice: Behavioural Analysis

**Fiction**: Perfect offender profiles

**Research-Based Reality**:

-   Probability statements instead of certainties (Alison et al., 2010)
-   "Actionable intelligence" approach (Rainbow et al., 2011)
-   Focused on investigation guidance, not suspect identification
-   Success measured by investigative value, not profile accuracy

**Research Finding**: Behavioral analysis works best as investigative support, not a "magic bullet"

::: notes
Research shows that effective behavioral analysis is much more modest in its claims than fictional portrayals.
The focus should be on providing useful direction to investigations rather than solving cases single-handedly.
:::

### 5. Emotional & Personality Assessment

# Emotional & Personality Assessment

::: notes
Let's examine the science behind understanding offender psychology.
:::

## Diagnostic Reasoning: The Medical Model

**The Concept**: Applying diagnostic frameworks to criminal behavior

**Research Evidence**:

-   Alison et al. (2013): Medical diagnostic models applied to crime analysis
-   Mellor et al. (2010): Symptom clusters approach for behavioral analysis
-   Crabbé et al. (2008): Differential diagnosis in crime scene analysis

**Research Findings**:

-   Structured approaches outperform intuitive analysis
-   Diagnostic frameworks reduce cognitive biases
-   Reliable for behavioral patterns, not personality traits

::: notes
The medical model of diagnosis provides a scientific framework that's more reliable than intuitive approaches.
This approach focuses on observed behaviors rather than speculating about personality.
:::

## Psychological Autopsy: Scientific Evidence

**The Concept**: Reconstructing a person's mental state posthumously

**Research Evidence**:

\- Isometsä (2001): 90% agreement with ante-mortem diagnoses

\- Hjelmeland et al. (2012): Standardized protocols improve reliability

\- Knoll (2008): Effective for equivocal death determination

**Scientific Applications**:

\- Suicide vs. homicide differentiation (Cooper & Eaves, 1996)

\- Risk factor identification (Cheng et al., 2000)

\- Preventive interventions development (Cavanagh et al., 2003)

**Limitations**: Retrospective bias, information availability, interviewer effects

::: notes
Psychological autopsy has stronger scientific support than many profiling techniques.
The research shows it can be reliable when conducted with standardized protocols.
:::

## Will Graham's "Pure Empathy" vs. Scientific Reality

**The Fiction**: Supernatural ability to "become" the killer

**The Science**:

-   Gröndahl & Kotsou (2022): Professional detectives show enhanced perspective-taking ability
-   Baker et al. (2013): Expert vs. novice differences in crime scene interpretation
-   Decety & Moriguchi (2007): Neurological basis of empathy

**Research Findings**:

-   Professional detachment improves accuracy (Ruffman et al., 2012)
-   Training enhances perspective-taking abilities (Hess et al., 2017)
-   Structured approaches outperform "pure intuition" (Alison et al., 2013)

::: notes
Research on empathy and perspective-taking shows that while these skills can be developed, they work best within structured frameworks.
Professional detachment, rather than emotional immersion, leads to more accurate analysis.
:::

## Psychopathy: Hollywood vs. Research

**The Fiction**: The brilliant, manipulative psychopath (Hannibal Lecter)

**The Science**:

-   Hare (2003): PCL-R assessment identifies psychopathic traits
-   Porter et al. (2009): Psychopathy relates to specific crime patterns
-   Woodworth & Porter (2002): Instrumental vs. reactive violence patterns

**Research Findings**:

-   Psychopathy exists on a spectrum (Edens et al., 2006)
-   Not all violent offenders are psychopaths (Skeem et al., 2011)
-   Most psychopaths are not criminal masterminds (Lilienfeld & Arkowitz, 2007)

::: notes
Research on psychopathy shows it's much more nuanced than typically portrayed in fiction.
Most real psychopaths lack the brilliance and sophistication of Hannibal Lecter.
:::

## Structured Assessment: The Research Evidence

**The Concept**: Using validated instruments to assess risk and traits

**Research Evidence**:

-   Douglas & Kropp (2002): Structured instruments outperform clinical judgment
-   Singh & Fazel (2010): Meta-analysis shows moderate predictive validity
-   Hart et al. (2007): HCR-20 predicts violence with AUC of .70-.80

**Major Validated Tools**:

-   HCR-20 for violence risk
-   PCL-R for psychopathy
-   Static-99 for sexual recidivism
-   VRAG for general violence

**Research Finding**: Structured tools consistently outperform clinical judgment alone

::: notes
Research overwhelmingly supports the use of structured assessment instruments over intuitive judgments.
These tools demonstrate reasonable predictive validity when properly applied.
:::

## Emotional Assessment: Research to Practice

**Fiction**: Perfect insight into criminal minds

**Research-Based Reality**:

-   Risk probability statements instead of certainties
-   Focus on behaviors rather than motivations
-   Emphasis on preventive interventions
-   Combined methods outperform single approaches

**Research Finding**: Effective assessment requires validated tools, multiple methods, and ongoing review

::: notes
Research shows that emotional and personality assessment works best when it uses structured tools and focuses on observable behaviors rather than speculative motivation.
Integrating multiple assessment methods improves reliability.
:::

### 6. Deception Detection

# Deception Detection Research

::: notes
Now we'll examine what science tells us about detecting lies.
:::

## The Truth About Lie Detection: Research Evidence

**Fiction**: Cal Lightman's perfect accuracy reading microexpressions

**Research Reality**:

-   Bond & DePaulo (2006): Meta-analysis of 206 studies shows 54% accuracy (just above chance)
-   Ekman & O'Sullivan (1991): Even trained professionals rarely exceed 65% accuracy
-   Vrij et al. (2010): No reliable nonverbal "tell" exists across individuals

**Research Conclusion**: Human ability to detect deception based on behavior is poor

::: notes
The research consistently shows that human lie detection abilities are much weaker than portrayed in fiction.
Even trained professionals perform only slightly better than chance in controlled studies.
:::

## Paul Ekman's Actual Research vs. "Lie To Me"

**The Fiction**: Perfect detection through facial microexpressions

**The Science**:

-   Ekman & Friesen (1969): Identified universal facial expressions
-   Porter & ten Brinke (2008): Microexpressions occur in only \~2% of deceptive statements
-   Matsumoto & Hwang (2011): Training improves recognition by 9-22%

**Research Limitations**:

-   Microexpressions occur in both truthful and deceptive individuals
-   Cultural differences affect expression and interpretation
-   Training produces modest improvements, not perfection

::: notes
Ekman's actual research is valuable but has been dramatically overstated in fictional portrayals.
Microexpressions exist but are much rarer and less reliable than shown in "Lie To Me."
:::

## Current Scientific Approaches to Lie Detection

**Research-Supported Methods**:

-   Cognitive load techniques (Vrij et al., 2008): 72% accuracy
-   Strategic use of evidence (Hartwig et al., 2014): 85% accuracy
-   Reality Monitoring (Masip et al., 2005): 71% accuracy
-   Computer-assisted linguistic analysis (Fuller et al., 2013): 76% accuracy

**Multi-Method Approaches**:

-   Combined verbal/nonverbal analysis (Porter & ten Brinke, 2010)
-   Context-sensitive approaches (Blair et al., 2010)
-   Baseline comparison methods (Vrij, 2008)

::: notes
Research shows that newer approaches to deception detection show promise.
The most effective methods focus on cognitive aspects rather than nonverbal "tells." Multi-method approaches consistently outperform single-method detection.
:::

## From Research to Practice: Deception Detection

**Fiction**: Instant lie detection through facial analysis

**Research-Based Reality**:

-   Strategic interviewing techniques (Vrij et al., 2015)
-   Information-gathering approaches (Meissner et al., 2012)
-   Unanticipated questions method (Vrij et al., 2009)
-   Cognitive credibility assessment (Vrij et al., 2017)

**Research Finding**: Effective deception detection requires structured approaches and multiple methods

::: notes
Research demonstrates that deception detection works best through strategic interviewing rather than passive observation.
This contradicts the typical Hollywood portrayal of the human lie detector.
:::

### 7. Evaluating Profiling Effectiveness

# Can Profiling Actually Work? The Evidence

::: notes
Let's critically examine the scientific evidence for profiling's effectiveness.
:::

## Approaches to Evaluating Effectiveness

Six ways researchers assess if profiling works:

1.  Expert perception studies
2.  Systematic reviews/meta-analyses
3.  Testing core assumptions
4.  Profile accuracy studies
5.  Content analysis of profiles
6.  Utility testing in investigations

**Research Question**: Does profiling provide value beyond chance?

::: notes
Understanding how profiling is evaluated scientifically helps us separate evidence from myth.
Multiple methodologies are needed to fully assess profiling's effectiveness.
:::

## Systematic Reviews & Meta-analyses

**Key Research**:

-   Snook et al. (2007): Profilers outperform non-profilers (62% vs. 38%)
-   Dowden et al. (2007): Geographic profiling shows strongest empirical support
-   Fox & Farrington (2018): Statistical approaches outperform clinical methods

**Research Findings**:

-   Modest evidence for profiling expertise effect
-   Stronger support for geographic than psychological profiling
-   Some profiling elements have empirical validity

::: notes
Scientific reviews of profiling show mixed evidence for its effectiveness.
Statistical approaches consistently outperform clinical judgment methods.
:::

## Testing Core Assumptions: Research Evidence

**Key Studies**:

-   Doan & Snook (2008): No empirical support for Holmes & Holmes typologies
-   Mokros & Alison (2002): Limited support for homology assumption
-   Woodhams & Toye (2007): Moderate support for behavioral consistency

**Research on Profile Content**:

-   Torres et al. (2006): 80% of profiles lack structured argumentation
-   Alison et al. (2003): Under 31% of profile statements are falsifiable
-   Copson et al. (2010): Barnum effect in profile evaluation

::: notes
Research testing the core assumptions of profiling finds limited support.
Many profiles contain vague statements that could apply to many offenders.
:::

## Utility Testing: A Reason for Hope

**Promising Research**:

-   [Fox & Farrington (2015): Statistical Patterns of Offending Typology SPOT burglary profiling showed positive impact](https://cebcp.org/evidence-based-policing/the-matrix/individuals/individuals-fox-and-farrington-2015/)
-   Kocsis (2006): Structured profiles improved investigative efficiency
-   Knabe-Nicol & Alison (2011): Investigators report practical value

**Key Elements of Successful Applications**:

-   Focus on actionable intelligence
-   Integration with other investigative methods
-   Statistical rather than clinical approach
-   Specific rather than general claims

::: notes
Research on the practical utility of profiling shows more promise than tests of theoretical accuracy.
When profiling focuses on practical investigative guidance, it shows greater value.
:::

## What Real-Life Profilers Actually Do

**Daily Work Reality**:

-   Risk assessments for violence/recidivism (Heilbrun et al., 2017)
-   Court-ordered evaluations (Otto & Heilbrun, 2002)
-   Standardized psychological testing (Archer et al., 2006)
-   Consultation on interview strategies (Vrij et al., 2017)

**Research Finding**: Forensic psychology practice differs substantially from TV portrayals

::: notes
The actual work of forensic psychologists focuses more on structured assessment and consultation than dramatic crime-solving.
This creates a significant gap between public perception and practice reality.
:::

## The Elements Worth Believing In: Research Evidence

Research shows some elements of profiling **do** work:

-   **Geographic profiling**: Strong statistical foundations (Rossmo, 2000)
-   **Behavioral linkage**: Connecting series of crimes (Woodhams et al., 2007)
-   **Statistical methods**: Data-driven approaches show promise (Canter et al., 2013)
-   **Structured professional judgment**: Combining expertise with tools (Guy et al., 2012)
-   **Team-based approaches**: Multiple perspectives yield better results (Alison et al., 2015)

::: notes
While the Hollywood version of profiling lacks scientific support, specific elements have demonstrated value.
The research suggests focused applications rather than broad profiling claims.
:::

### 8. The Digital Transformation

# The Evolution of Profiling: Digital Research

::: notes
Now we'll explore how digitalization is transforming profiling practices!
Surely this is crucial?
:::

## Key Transformations in Criminal Profiling: Research

Based on Mateo-Fernandez & Osa-Subtil (2024):

-   Traditional approach: Based on physical environment patterns

-   Digital era approach: Incorporates digital footprints and online behavior

-   

    > 70% of criminal profiles now include social media analysis

-   AI algorithms significantly enhance profile accuracy

**Research Finding**: Digital environments provide rich behavioral data

::: notes
Recent research shows how profiling is evolving to incorporate digital evidence.
This represents a significant advancement in behavioral analysis techniques.
:::

## Digital Tools & Techniques: Empirical Evidence

**Research-Supported Approaches**:

\- **Social Network Analysis**: Relationship mapping (Décary-Hétu & Morselli, 2011)

\- **AI & Machine Learning**: Pattern detection (Brundage et al., 2018)

\- **Predictive Analytics**: Risk assessment (Wang et al., 2019)

\- **Dark Web Monitoring**: Criminal activity tracking (Mirea et al., 2019)

**Effectiveness Research**:

\- Accuracy rates 15-30% higher than traditional methods (Mateo-Fernandez & Osa-Subtil, 2024)

\- Reduced investigative time by average of 64% (Chen et al., 2018)

::: notes
Research demonstrates that digital analysis tools provide measurable improvements in profiling accuracy.
These technologies represent the cutting edge of behavioral analysis in investigations.
:::

## Enhanced Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Research

**The Approach**: Integrating experts from multiple fields

**Research Evidence**:

## Why Believing Matters: Research and Development

The profiling myth drives important advancements: - Interest in behavioral science research - Funding for empirical studies - Critical examination of investigative methods - Development of better analytical tools - Public engagement with forensic psychology

**Research Finding**: The quest to understand criminal behavior has scientific value

::: notes
While the Hollywood version of profiling lacks scientific support, the pursuit itself has value.
Research driven by profiling questions has advanced our understanding of criminal behaviour.
:::

## Conclusion: The Truth Is Out There

**The Research Verdict**:

-   Perfect TV profiler doesn't exist
-   Elements of profiling have empirical support
-   Scientific methods continue to improve
-   The field evolves through critical examination

**The Final Research Truth** : Real profiling isn't as dramatic as TV, but the quest to understand the criminal mind remains a worthwhile scientific journey.

*I want to believe...*

::: notes
The research shows that while the Hollywood version of profiling is largely fictional, there is scientific value in the pursuit of understanding criminal behaviour.
A critical, evidence-based approach offers the best path forward.

## Some Hare-Brained Schemes for Aspiring Profilers

### Operation Reddington

-   Become international criminal mastermind while maintaining impeccable fashion sense
-   Build elaborate global crime network while collecting fine art and rare wines
-   Turn yourself in specifically to the most earnest-looking FBI rookie
-   Insist on speaking only to the agency director while maintaining mysterious smirk
-   Offer to catch "much worse criminals" while never fully explaining your motives

::: notes
"The Blacklist" - gotta love Red!
:::

### The 'Murder Magnet' Phenomenon

-   Buy quaint cottage in small town with suspiciously high murder rate
-   Take up harmless hobby that gives you reason to wander into crime scenes
-   Befriend local police inspector despite their initial annoyance
-   Casually mention "psychological inconsistencies" at murder scenes
-   Begin every revelation with "Well, isn't it curious that..."
-   Slowly become indispensable while town's murder rate mysteriously increases

::: notes
See "cozy mystery" genre like "Murder, She Wrote" and similar shows.
:::

### The "Podcast Made Me Do It" Gambit

-   Launch a true crime podcast called "Profiles in Profile-ing"
-   Analyze famous cases with increasingly outlandish psychological theories
-   Attract the attention of a serial killer who starts leaving clues specifically for you
-   Become the "reluctant consultant" when police realize the killer will only communicate through you
-   Eventually get your own FBI lanyard that everyone pretends is official

::: notes
This references "Only Murders in the Building" or "My favourite murderer." - Stay classy and Don't Get Murdered!
:::

### The "Academic with a Twist" Approach

-   Become a second-rate psychology lecturer specializing in "theoretical criminal behaviour"
-   Write controversial paper challenging profiling methods
-   Get invited to debate techniques by annoyed profiler
-   Solve actual case during heated academic argument, entirely by accident
-   Receive reluctant job offer with lots of sabbatical leave

::: notes
This is a gentle self-deprecating joke about academics - honestly.
:::

## When you still don't get hired to solve crimes...

-   You can make a fortune consulting in business and move to Mauritius for the summer and winter in Gstaad!
-   Apply your "thin slicing" skills to predict which corporate mergers will fail
-   Use your "snooping" expertise to become an office design consultant
-   Rebrand "cold reading" as "intuitive executive coaching" and triple your fees
-   Start referring to suspicious Excel spreadsheets as showing "patterns consistent with embezzlement"
-   Develop a "Psychological Autopsy" service for failed product launches

**Remember:** A good trench coat, unusual personal habits, and the ability to make profound statements while staring dramatically into the distance are essential to any post-academic career!
